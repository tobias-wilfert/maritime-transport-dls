# Template Based Model-to-Text Transformation using EGL

### Goal
Our goal was to design to generate [Python PDEVS](https://msdl.uantwerpen.be/documentation/PythonPDEVS/) code from a Waterway Network Model. By exporting a model in [AToMPM](https://atompm.github.io) to [MetaDepth](http://metadepth.org) and then running an EGL transformation to generate the Python code.

### Outcome

### Files
- [DEVS/](/Model2TextTransformation/DEVS/): Folder containing the Python code needed for the model.
- [README.md](/Model2TextTransformation/README.md): This file.
- [exported_to_md/](/Model2TextTransformation/exported_to_md/): Folder that contains the logic to generate the Python model.
- [stats/](/Model2TextTransformation/stats/): Folder that contains generated statistics generated from the models.
- [CodeGenerationInAToMPM.pdf](/Model2TextTransformation/CodeGenerationInAToMPM.pdf): The project requirements.
