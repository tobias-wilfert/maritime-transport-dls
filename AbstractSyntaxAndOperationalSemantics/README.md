### Abstract Syntax and Operational semantics in metaDepth


TODOs:
- Mention where the metaDepth.jar is from and that we did not code it!
- We probably want to merge notes on MetaDepth.txt with this file and put the stuff in a Observations/Lessons Section
- Mention:
    - What we did
    - Why we did it 
    - How to run it 
    - Where to find what
    - What the final result is


#### What?
- [```NN.mdepth```](/AbstractSyntaxAndOperationalSemantics/NN.mdepth): **Thinks this is an ealier version of the desing :thinking: so we can probably remove it?**
- [```metaDepth.jar```](/AbstractSyntaxAndOperationalSemantics/metaDepth.jar): A textual modeling tool, more information about it can be found at [MetaDepth main page](http://metadepth.org).
- [```notes on MetaDepth.txt```](/AbstractSyntaxAndOperationalSemantics/notes%20on%20MetaDepth.txt): **Probably want to merge that knowledge into this file.**
- [```README.md```](/AbstractSyntaxAndOperationalSemantics/README.md): This file.
- [```run.sh```](/AbstractSyntaxAndOperationalSemantics/run.sh): Script file to start the MetaDepth tool.
- [```testing_models.txt```](/AbstractSyntaxAndOperationalSemantics/testing_models.txt): **Probably want to break that up in seperate files and put them all in a sub directory.**
- [```WaterwayModeligInMetaDepth.pdf```](/AbstractSyntaxAndOperationalSemantics/WaterwayModeligInMetaDepth.pdf): The project requirements.
- [```WMS.eol```](/AbstractSyntaxAndOperationalSemantics/WMS.eol): The operational semantics of the Water Modeling System.
- [```WMS.mds```](/AbstractSyntaxAndOperationalSemantics/WMS.mdc): MedaDepth helper file.
- [```WMS.mdepth```](/AbstractSyntaxAndOperationalSemantics/WMS.mdepth): The abstract syntax of the Water Modeling System.
- [```WMS.txt```](/AbstractSyntaxAndOperationalSemantics/WMS.txt): Generated graph representation of the Abstract syntax. **Insert the generated graph for this as well.**
