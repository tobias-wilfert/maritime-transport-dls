- EOL seems to give error when using '!=' instead of '<>'
- cannot access abstract base class variables in subclass (illegal access to 'identifier' example)
	â†’ example on slide 80/114 shows that it should be possible?

- does rate mean intervals inbetween or inclusive (rate of 2 means push a ship every two timesteps, or wait 2 timesteps before pushing)




	
Can I change the splash screen?
